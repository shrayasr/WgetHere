# wget here!

## Problem

There have been many a time where I've just wanted to quickly download jquery
to a particular directory but then in order to _just_ do that I'll have to open
up a git bash terminal, and then wget it. 

## Solution

BOOM, wget here opens up a small window to type out the url one wants to wget,
this downloads the file from that url to the current directory where the
program was launched from

## Tips

For best experience, add WgetHere.exe to path after compilation and add it to
the context menu ([tutorial](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-any-application-to-the-desktop-right-click-menu-in-vista/))
so that it can be launched from anywhere
